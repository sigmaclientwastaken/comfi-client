## Why
Because I literally couldn't find any ghost clients for newer versions.

## TODO List
- Finish the base.

## Features List
- literally nothing

# Contributing
Make a pull request with your changes and I will look at it at some point.

# Usage
Just build a jar like you normally would with a fabric mod. If you can't figure it out, that's not my problem. \
